Simulates the trajectory of a projectile in real-time.

**Author:** Edwin Wagha (me)

**Dependencies:** Python, Matplotlib

## Class: Projectile
- Represents a projectile with speed, launch angle, and height.
- Calculates position, velocity, drag force, and acceleration due to drag.

## Function: plot_trajectory_realtime
- Plots the trajectory of the projectile.

## Usage:
1. Run the script.
2. Enter initial speed, launch angle, and initial height.
3. Watch the real-time plot of the projectile's trajectory.

**Note:** Adjust the plotting range based on the projectile's maximum range.
